This example includes a basic structure and some interactivity.\n\n### Example: Simple Webpage\n\n#### HTML (index.html)\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n    <title>Simple Website</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header>\n        <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n        <button id=\"clickMe\">Click Me!</button>\n        <p id=\"message\"></p>\n    </main>\n    <footer>\n        <p>&copy; 2023 My Simple Website</p>\n    </footer>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### CSS (styles.css)\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 20px;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\nheader {\n    background-color: #4CAF50;\n    color: white;\n    padding: 10px 0;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nbutton {\n    padding: 10px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n\nfooter {\n    text-align: center;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript (script.js)\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('clickMe').onclick = function() {\n    document.getElementById('message').innerText = \"Hello! You clicked the button!\";\n};\n```\n\n### How to Run This Website\n\n1. **Create the Files**: Create three files named `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.\n2. **Copy the Code**: Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into their respective files.\n3. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in a web browser, and you will see a simple webpage with a button that displays a message when clicked.\n\nIf you want to add more features or have specific requirements for your website, let me know, and I can help you expand on it!"
